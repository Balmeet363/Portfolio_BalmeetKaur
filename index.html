						<h2>New job Experience</h2>
						<div class="job-detail">
							<p>
							I am sharing my experience after getting my first job. I have done Bachelor of computer Science
							from India and I got my first job as a Software Developer in 2016. I was very happy because I got
							a chance to lend my skills in the development industry.I met new developers over there who helped 
							me a lot to enhance my skills.Senior developers taught me to solve problems by explaining, identifying
							and finding a sloution. I became a good learner over there. I learned various languages like Advanced Java,
							C# amd C++. The company atmosphere always encouraged me to be punctual and accomplish the task before the 
							deadline.To enhance my skills further in the IT environment, I decided on the idea of moving to a foreign country 
							for education.I am in my last semester now. I wanted to be a Front-End Web Developer and work in a company.
							I can easily adjust myself in company environment.I am working hard so that God can fulfil my dreams and I can 
							easily accomplish my destiny.

						<h2>Learned New Concept</h2>
						<div class="concept-detail">
							<p>
						    Communication with people all over the world has become easy nowadays due to advancement in technology.
							At first, people started sending messages through letters but now a person can easily view another person 
							from a far distance.Here I want to share idea of one feature made in a project based on sending messages.I 
							was working on a team project named Calorie Tracker that calculates the number of calories required by a 
							person per day. My feature was to send a message to a person through an email regarding the required consumption of calories.
							I had never learned how to send an email but I wanted to accomplish the task before the deadline. 
							I collaborated with my team and discussed my problem.We all team members figured out a way to send an email.
							I was happy that until know, the Gmail account which I ue daily to send emails, I know the exact coding of this account
							to send an email.Being a web developer and working in a team always taught me a way to corporate in a team, slove the 
							problem by discussing it and working hard to solve a problem until it meets a solution.
