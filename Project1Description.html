		<h1>Calorie Tracker</h1>
		<p>Calorie tracker Is a web application to track the calorie of a person. Precisely it will ask the user to 
		select the items that he consumes in a day based on the dietary chart visible. Based on the selection the user 
		will get to know how much calories is consumed. For the logged in user, depending on their given information, 
		the application will notify the user about their calorie limitation for the day.This system will help the user 
		to achieve their calorie counter goals. The user will be able to count their calories as per consumed food and 
		activities. Users can get the estimate of how many calories they should have throughout the day. It gives them 
		motivation by having fun while using the system and keeping up using the calorie tracker to balance healthy life.

		<h2>Thought Process of Features:</h2>
		<h2>User Information Form</h2>
		<p>Registered or non registered user is required to fill out the form . Users are required to fill age, weight, 
		height, select gender and have to choose activity on a daily basis. Based on the information provided, the number 
		of calories to be consumed per day by the user is displayed to him with BMR value. Users can only read the value 
		of the result.</p>
		
		<h2>Intake Notification</h2>
		<p>Notification will be sent to the user via email as per how many calories to take per day. Only the admin is 
		allowed to send notifications. For this notification a user must be a registered user. List of notifications sent 
		to particular users are displayed on the admin home page.</p>
		
		<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
		<p>Challenge that I faced was sending an email. I worked really hard on this feature , searched a lot about PhpMailer 
		to send an email. Finally I got that because of small version of WAMP Server on my laptop, PhpMailer was not working.
        I discussed problem with my team members. They suggested me to try code on different laptop. I tried same code on my 
		sisterâ€™s laptop by again installing PHPStorm and WAMP Server  then email functionality started working.</p>
